# Autofix - The Auto Repair Service

## Setup Guide
1. The `Autofix` is a modern `NextJs` `/app` routing application. `NextJs` runs on `NodeJs`, you need to install `NodeJs` first on your machine. 


2. Then you have to install the necessary package and open a terminal in the project directory.
```bash
# Install package
npm install
# run on development mode
npm run dev
```

3. Ready for production build
```bash
# build command
npm run build
# run on production
npm start
```

If you run the last command, it will run your application on the `3000` port.


Congratulation!!

3. How to edit:
Start editing from the `/src/app/page.tsx` file. The `/src/app/page.tsx` file is the main entry file for the application. `/src/app` folder, where you get all the pages and APIs. The `/src/components` folder is where you will find all the components. The `/src/hooks` folder is where you will get all the hooks. The `/src/lib` folder is where you will get all the utility files.
